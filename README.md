# Vehicle Control System

## Description

### This project simulates a Vehicle Control System in C programming. It allows users to control the vehicleâ€™s engine, speed, and manage sensor-based features such as traffic light control, room temperature, and engine temperature.

## Features

### 1. Turn the vehicle engine on or off.

### 2. Control vehicle speed based on traffic light color.

### 3. Adjust room temperature using a sensor (AC on/off).

### 4. Manage engine temperature with an engine temperature controller.

### 5. Real-time, interactive menu-driven system.

## How to Use

### 1. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).

### 2. Run the executable.

### 3. Choose from the available options:

#### a. Turn on the vehicle engine

#### b. Turn off the vehicle engine

#### c. Quit the system

### 4. Once the engine is on, you can interact with the sensor menu to adjust vehicle settings.

## Requirements

### A C compiler (e.g., GCC) for compiling the code.

## License

### This project is open-source.
